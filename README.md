- 👋 Hi, I’m @digicinematic, a.k.a. Brian.
- 👀 I’m interested in science fiction and fantasy movies + tv shows.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust (for systems development), Cypher and operCypher (for Neo4j and RedisGraph graph databases), and LXD (for self-hosting some of my microservices).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a student management system.
- 📫 You can reach me at brian@digicinematic.co.nz
